# Random_Knight_Tour
A break-down easy version of Knight Tour.
The code is my take on a difficult problem of Knight Tour.Instead of the traditional way to assigning values to chess sqaures using the Ulam spiral,
  my implementation just randomly selects a new position from the possible positions and repeat the process again with the selected poistion.
The main motive behind it was to just visualize how will the pattern look when plotted. 
(Traditional version might follow soon).
